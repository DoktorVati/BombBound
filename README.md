# BombBound
This game was developed using the Unity Software program alongside visual studio using C# coding language.  
I created all of the aspects included in this game.  This includes, code, artwork, music, sounds, and implementation of microtransactions and advertisements. 
This was developed over the span of 3 months.  This game is meant to be challenging, so there are many features implemented to slow down progression such as the bounciness, time limit, and the dangerous environment the player is maneuvering through to get to the goal.
